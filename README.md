# ExpectedValue
Based on a coding project for a job interview.

There are two files associated with this code.  One is a list of depth values from 0 metres to 10 metres.  The other file has a list of depth ranges in one column and a figure associated with that depth range.  Eg.  0-1m, 10,000 etc

The aim is to bin the depth values into the specified depth ranges, calculate the probabilities, multiply them with the associated figure and sum the total.
